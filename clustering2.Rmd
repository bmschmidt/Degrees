This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
source("functions.R")
schools = loadSchoolTable()
table = cleanupTable(schools)
table = reformatDisciplines(table)
library(data.table)
array = dcast(melt(table[,c("year","gender","level","institution","discipline","majors")]),institution~...)
(array$institution)
m = dist(array)
names(m) = array$institution
plot(hclust(log(m)),horiz=T,label=array$institution)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
